# Filtering Feature

## Overview
This feature provides server-side filtering capabilities that allow users to filter courses based on categories. The filtering works with server-rendered pages for SEO-friendly, accessible interactions.

## Functional Requirements

* **Category Filtering**: Allow users to filter courses by category
* **Multiple Selection**: Support single or multiple category selection
* **Filter UI**: Provide an intuitive interface for category selection
* **Real-time Filtering**: Apply filters immediately when user makes selections
* **Clear Filters**: Provide option to clear all active filters
* **Filter State**: Maintain filter state during user session
* **Combined Filtering**: Filtering should work seamlessly with search functionality

## Technical Implementation

* **Server-side Processing**: All filtering operations performed on server with Express routes
* **Template Engine**: EJS for rendering filter components and results
* **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 for filter interface styling and responsive behavior
* **Filter Logic**: Implement efficient filtering algorithms using TypeScript/JavaScript
* **State Management**: Use URL query parameters and server-side session management
* **Performance**: Optimize filtering with server-side caching for large datasets
* **Filter Persistence**: Maintain filter state via URL parameters and server sessions

## Data Integration

* **Categories Source**: Filter options populated from Categories sheet
* **Category Mapping**: Map category_id from courses to category names for display
* **Dynamic Options**: Category filter options update dynamically based on available data

## User Interface Requirements

* **Filter Controls**: Use Bootstrap 5 form components (checkboxes, dropdowns, buttons) for filter interface
* **Visual Indicators**: Show active filters with Bootstrap 5 badge and button components
* **Filter Summary**: Display count of filtered results using Bootstrap 5 alert or card components
* **Responsive Design**: Leverage Bootstrap 5 responsive utilities for all device sizes
* **Accessibility**: Bootstrap 5 built-in accessibility features with proper form semantics

## User Experience

* **Immediate Feedback**: Filters apply immediately without requiring a submit action
* **Clear State**: Users can easily see what filters are active
* **Reset Functionality**: Quick way to clear all filters and return to full course list
* **Filter Combination**: Multiple filters should work together logically (AND operation)
* **Empty States**: Handle gracefully when no courses match selected filters

## Implementation Notes

* **Filter Performance**: Server-side filtering with caching for optimal performance
* **URL State**: Filter state maintained in URL query parameters for shareable views
* **Testing**: Implement comprehensive tests for Express routes and filter logic
* **Future Enhancements**: Consider adding more filter criteria (price, difficulty, etc.)
