## Search Feature Requirements

### Overview
This document outlines the search functionality for the course listing website. The search feature will allow users to quickly find courses by searching through course titles and descriptions.

---

### Functional Requirements

* **Search Bar**: Implement a search input field prominently displayed on the main page
* **Real-time Search**: The search should filter results as the user types (debounced for performance)
* **Search Scope**: Search functionality will match against course titles and descriptions
* **Search Logic**: Implement case-insensitive search with partial matching
* **Search Results**: Display filtered courses in the same layout as the main course list
* **Search State**: Maintain search state and allow users to clear search results
* **No Results**: Display appropriate messaging when no courses match the search criteria
* **Search Persistence**: Search term should persist during navigation within the application

### Technical Implementation

* **Server-side Processing**: All searching performed server-side with Express routes
* **Template Engine**: EJS for rendering search interface and results
* **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 for search input styling and responsive design
* **Performance**: Server-side caching and efficient query processing
* **Search Algorithm**: Use TypeScript/JavaScript string methods for matching (toLowerCase, includes)
* **Integration**: Search functionality should work seamlessly with category filtering via URL parameters
* **State Management**: Use URL query parameters and server-side session management

### User Experience Requirements

* **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap 5 input groups for responsive search across all devices
* **Clear Search**: Bootstrap 5 button components for easy search clearing
* **Search Placeholder**: Use Bootstrap 5 form control with descriptive placeholder text

### Implementation Notes

* **Search Performance**: For large datasets, consider implementing more advanced search algorithms
* **Future Enhancements**: Consider adding search highlighting in results
* **Accessibility**: Ensure search functionality is accessible via keyboard navigation
* **Testing**: Implement unit tests for search logic and integration tests for user interactions
